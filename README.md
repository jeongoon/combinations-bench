# Just For Fun Benchmark for combinations

I like combiantions. and I found my module competitive with others.
At the same time I'd like to improve my code as wel.

I am trying to code in many language but
`golang` is super fast for any imperative implementation.

I don't know how to write down in rust which I'd like to learn some day.
But I guess, I will try to code in C++ first.

# Recursive Combinations cannot beat the Imperative Combinations?

Still I have no idea, however imperative my implentation tends to
win the race with recursive one.
